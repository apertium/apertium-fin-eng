# Finnish and English: `apertium-fin-eng`

This is an Apertium language pair for translating between Finnish and
English. What you can use this language package for:

* Translating between Finnish and English
* Morphological analysis of Finnish and English
* Part-of-speech tagging of Finnish and English

For information on the latter two points, see subheading "For more
information" below.

This package is made out of following components (directly, semiautomatically,
etc.):

- Omorfi
- FinnWordNet
- Fred Karlsson’s Finnish CG rules
- Grammatical Framework's Finnish–English data
- fi.wiktionary.org
- Europarl

## Requirements

You will need the following software installed:

* autoconf
* automake
* pkg-config
* lttoolbox (>= 3.5.1)
* apertium (>= 3.6.1)
* vislcg3 (>= 1.3.1)
* hfst (>= 3.15.1)
* apertium-fin
* apertium-eng

If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at: apertium.org.

## Compiling

Given the requirements being installed, you should be able to just run:

```console
$ autoreconf -fvi
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
```

You can use `./autogen.sh` instead of `autoreconf` and `./configure` in case
you're compiling from source. If you installed any prerequisite language
packages using a `--prefix` with `./configure`, make sure to use the same
`--prefix` when running `./configure` here.

If any of this doesn't make sense or doesn't work, see
https://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Install_language_data_by_compiling

## Testing

If you are in the source directory after running make, the following
commands should work:

```console
$ echo "talo" | apertium -d . fin-eng
house

$ echo "house" | apertium -d . eng-fin
talo
```

After installing somewhere in `$PATH`, you should be able to do e.g.

```console
$ echo "talo" | apertium fin-eng
house
```
